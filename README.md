# Face Emotion Recognition

This project utilizes the FER-2013 dataset to recognize facial emotions. It consists of two main components:

1. Real-Time Recognition: Real-time detection and recognition of facial emotions.
2. Input-Based Recognition: Allows users to select an image or video file from their system for emotion recognition.

## Dataset

The FER-2013 dataset is a publicly available dataset containing grayscale images of faces labeled with one of seven emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, or neutral. You can find more information and download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013).

## Model

The model used in this project achieves an accuracy of approximately 65%. You can download the model from [here](https://github.com/HarshitWaldia/Face_Emotion_Recognition/tree/main/Emotion-Model).

## Usage

### Real-Time Recognition

1. Navigate to the `realtime` directory : [Real-Time](https://github.com/HarshitWaldia/Face_Emotion_Recognition/blob/main/Real_Time_Emotion_Detection.ipynb)
2. Run the real-time recognition script.
3. The script will start a real-time video feed, detecting and recognizing emotions in faces.

### Input-Based Recognition

1. Navigate to the `input_based` directory : [Input-Based](https://github.com/HarshitWaldia/Face_Emotion_Recognition/blob/main/Input_based_Emotion_Detection.ipynb)
2. Run the input-based recognition script.
3. Follow the instructions to select an image or video file from your system for emotion recognition.
